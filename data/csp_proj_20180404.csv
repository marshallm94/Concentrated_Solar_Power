Andasol-1 is the first parabolic trough power plant in Europe. Located in southern Spain, this 300 million Euro power plant has been under construction since June 2006 and began operating in 2008. The nominal production capacity of 50 megawatts is enough electricity for up to 200,000 people. A two-tank indirect thermal storage system holds 28,500 tons of molten salt, and this reservoir can run the turbine for up to 7.5 hours at full load. Andasol-1 and two upcoming companion plants will help the Spanish power grid meet peak summer demand primarily caused by the high energy consumption of air conditioning units.","photo_anda_sol.jpg","Photo of four sections of parabolic troughs segmented by access roads, with each section having about 100 rows of troughs.

Abengoa Solar's Planta Solar 10 is the first solar central-receiver system producing grid-connected electricity under a purely commercial approach. PS10's technologies—including glass-metal heliostats, pressurized-water thermal storage system, and saturated-steam receiver and turbine—were previously tested and qualified at the Plataforma Solar de Almería facility. This testing helped to avoid technological uncertainties and allowed the project to focus on scaling up, integrating subsystems, demonstrating dispatchability, and reducing O&M costs. The plant's thermal storage system has a 50-minute capacity at 50% load to handle cloud transients. The tower was designed to reduce visual impact—its relatively narrow body includes a large open space to give a lightweight sense.","photo_ps-10.jpg","Photo taken from the air that shows a tall tower toward the left rising above a flat field.

For example, designing a natural circulation receiver and increasing incident solar radiation capture will increase net electrical power output by 10 percent. The 160-meter tower was designed to reduce the visual impact of its height. The plant has the capacity to generate more than 40 gigawatt-hours of energy each year, enough to supply power to 10,000 homes.","photo_ps-20.jpg","Photo of the central tower of the power tower system.

The CSP plant is hybridized with two biomass units (2 x 22 MW thermal) that supply the required thermal energy to the power block enabling the electrical production with low or with absence of solar irradiation, increasing the overall efficiency, allowing a continuous operation of the steam turbine (by avoiding daily start-up’s and shut downs) and therefore, making possible a better use of the thermal block as well as the electrical infrastructure of the plant. The plant is able to produce electricity around-the-clock in a dispatchable way by the use of renewable sources (solar and biomass). The plant uses a combination of waste forest biomass (main fuel) and energy crops.","","","","","Published"
